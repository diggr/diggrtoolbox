Welcome to diggrtoolbox documentation!
======================================

diggrtoolbox is a collection of various loosely coupled or completely
independent tools, which were developed during the first phase of the
diggr (databased infrastructure for global game culture research) project at
the university library in Leipzig.

The tools are mostly small helpers meant to ease the handling of data and
data structures we encountered during this research project.
