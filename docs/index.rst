Welcome to diggrtoolbox documentation!
======================================

diggrtoolbox is a collection of various loosely coupled or completely
independent tools, which were developed during the first phase of the
diggr (databased infrastructure for global game culture research) project at
the university library in Leipzig.

The tools are mostly small helpers meant to ease the handling of data and
data structures we encountered during this research project.

.. note:: The main development paradigm for this library was and is: Providing tools, which have few to no additional/external dependencies, especially no requirement for any services to be run in the network, e.g. elasticsearch, CouchDB, etc. It is a toolbox made for Digital Humanities Researchers who do not have access to a huge technical infrastructure.
